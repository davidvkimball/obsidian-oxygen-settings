# Oxygen Theme Settings

Settings plugin for [Oxygen Theme](https://github.com/davidvkimball/obsidian-oxygen). Forked from [Minimal Theme Settings](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal-settings).

## What makes Oxygen different

**Create your own color presets** - The key difference from Minimal Theme Settings is the ability to create, edit, and manage custom color schemes directly in the plugin settings. Build your own presets with custom accent colors, backgrounds, and interface colors without needing external tools. Although it still works with the [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) plugin.

## Features

**Custom color presets** - Create and manage your own color schemes with a built-in preset editor.

**Built-in color schemes** - Includes the 14 preset color schemes from Minimal: Atom, Ayu, Catppuccin, Dracula, Everforest, Flexoki, Gruvbox, macOS, Nord, Ros√© Pine, Solarized, and more.

**Background styles** - Toggle between default, low contrast, high contrast (light mode), and true black (dark mode) backgrounds via hotkeys.

**Customization** - Control fonts, sizes, line width, link styles, focus mode, icons, image grids, and width settings for tables, images, and iframes.

**Hotkeys** - Quick toggles for light/dark mode, cycling color schemes, adjusting font size, and toggling interface elements.
